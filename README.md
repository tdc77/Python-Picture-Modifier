# Python-Picture-Modifier

This is a simple picture modifier for python.  For now it adds greyscale, resizes or rotates.  I will add more functionaly later.

You can open a picture, modify it and save modified picture to your computer.

3-24-25:
picture_v2 is newest file, added blur, sharpen and thumbnail.  Use picture_v2 instead of main.py

3-25-25 Added crop functionality and an exit button to close program.  Seems to be a small issue with overlap on the canvas but doesnt cause 
an issue but something that may need to be fixed later on. Use picture_v3
